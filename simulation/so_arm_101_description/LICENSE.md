`so_arm_101_description` is distributed as part of the
[SO-ARM100/101 Parallel Gripper](https://github.com/roboninecom/SO-ARM100-101-Parallel-Gripper)
project, which is multi-licensed. This file describes the package so it is
self-explanatory when installed or redistributed on its own.

## Meshes — read before reusing

`meshes/` is not uniformly licensed:

- `clamp_1.stl`, `clamp_2.stl` are Robonine's gripper geometry, **CERN-OHL-P-2.0**.
- `base_link.stl`, `link1_1.stl` … `link4_1.stl` are the SO-ARM101 **arm**, derived
  from the upstream [SO-ARM100/101 project by
  TheRobotStudio](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) and licensed
  **Apache-2.0**. They are not Robonine's work.
- `link5_1.stl` fuses upstream wrist geometry with Robonine's main frame in a
  single body and is **Apache-2.0** in full.

The robot description under `urdf/` is licensed as software rather than as
hardware: it encodes kinematics and inertial parameters for the whole arm, much
of which describes upstream geometry that Robonine does not own.

Full licence texts live in the repository root as `HARDWARE-LICENSE.txt`,
`SOFTWARE-LICENSE.txt` and `DOCS-LICENSE.txt` (and again under their SPDX names
in `LICENSES/`, as the REUSE Specification requires). See also `LICENSING.md`
for the full map, `NOTICE` for third-party attribution, and `REUSE.toml` for the
machine-readable version.
