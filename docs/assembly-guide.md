This guide provides step-by-step instructions for assembling the parallel gripper. Follow these steps carefully to ensure proper operation.

## Required Tools

- Phillips head screwdriver PH1
- Hex keys M2 (H1.5) and M4 (H2.5)

## Step 1: Install Gear on Servo

![Servo with gear assembly](../assets/images/assembly/02-servo-with-gear-assembly.png)

**Components needed:**
- 1x Feetech STS3215 Servo
- 1x Gear  (RB9.01.062.040)
- 1x Servo disk (from servo kit)
- 1x Servo mounting screw M3x6 (from servo kit)
- 4x Set Screw DIN 913 M3x4

**Instructions:**
1. Place Gear for Gripper on Servo disk and tighten 4x Set Screws M3x4 in the direction from Servo disk to Gear. Make sure that no gap appears between Disk and Gear when tightening the screws.
2. Mount the gear assembly onto the servo output shaft.
3. Secure with the screw M3x6 provided in the servo kit.

## Step 2: Servo Positioning and Torque Limit

![Servo positioning](../assets/images/assembly/Feetech-Servo-Window.png)

**Components needed:**
- Existing SO-ARM100/101 controller, servo cable, and arm power supply

**Instructions for Windows users:**
1. Connect the servo to the existing arm controller through the servo bus and connect the controller to the PC by USB. Use the arm power supply. Configure a unique servo ID before adding the gripper to the chain; close other robot-control applications before opening the COM port.
2. Configure the servo with Feetech's **FD** (SCServo Debug) tool. It is closed-source
   Windows software from Feetech and is **not** redistributed in this repository:
   - Official download: <https://www.feetechrc.com/software.html> — look for the FD /
     SCServo Debug archive. Some downloads there are password-protected; request the
     password from Feetech.
   - Open-source cross-platform alternative:
     <https://github.com/Kotakku/FT_SCServo_Debug_Qt>

   The steps below describe the FD interface; the alternative exposes the same
   parameters under similar names.
3. Choose your COM port, select BaudRate 1 000 000, push buttons "Open" and after "Search".
4. Below from the list select your servo.
5. Check the box to enable torque on servo.
6. Move the slider to the left.

7. Switch the window to a tab "Programming".
8. Choose parameter "Max Torque Limit", set it to 500 ans press "Save".

## Step 3: Clamps

![Clamps](../assets/images/assembly/clamp+rack+nail.PNG)

**Components needed:**
- 2x Clamps (RB9.01.062.021)
- 2x Gear racks (RB9.01.062.031)
- 2x Nails (RB9.01.062.100)

**Instructions:**
1. Insert gear racks in clamps from side direction.
2. Then insert nails from back direction.

---

## Step 4: Rods

![Rods](../assets/images/assembly/rods+clamps.PNG)

**Components needed:**
- 2x Rods D6x125mm

**Instructions:**
1. Insert the rods into both clamps. If you ordered rods/tubes longer than 125 mm you need to cut them to this length.

---

## Step 5: Install Bearings on Main Frame

![Bearings installed on main frame](../assets/images/assembly/frame+bearings.png)

**Components needed:**
- 2x MF106ZZ Bearings (10x6x3 mm)
- 2x M4x8 DIN 7991 screws

**Instructions:**
1. Insert the 2x MF106ZZ bearings into their designated positions on the main frame. Bearing flange should face up.
2. Secure each bearing with screw M4x8.

---

## Step 6: Connection of rods and frame

![Connection of rods and main frame](../assets/images/assembly/frame-with-clamps.png)

**Instructions:**
1. Snap the rods into the frame.
2. Spread the clamps to the extreme positions on the left and right.

---

## Step 7: Mount Servo on Main Frame

![Servo mounted on main frame](../assets/images/assembly/servo-on-frame.png)

**Components needed:**
- 3x Self-tapping screws (from servo kit)

**Instructions:**
1. Position the servo on the main frame and align mounting holes.
2. Secure the servo using 3x self-tapping screws from the servo kit.

## Step 8: Gripper Holder Attachment

![Gripper holder attachment](../assets/images/assembly/09-gripper-holder-attachment.png)

**Components needed:**
- 1x Camera holder (RB9.01.060.074) or Holder (RB9.01.060.080)
- 1x SO-ARM101
- 4x M3x6 Screws (from servo kit)
- 4x Self-tapping screws (from servo kit)

**Instructions:**
1. If you plan to use Gripper with camera then attach Camera holder, if you plan to use Gripper without camera then attach Holder to the Wrist Joint horn of SO-ARM101 and fix with 4x M3x6 screws
2. Attach the Parallel Gripper to the Camera holder or Holder and fix with 4x self-tapping screws
3. Connect cable from the Parallel Gripper to servo №5 of SO-ARM101

---

## Step 9: Camera Attachment (optional)

![Camera attachment](../assets/images/assembly/camera-attachment.png)

**Components needed:**
- 1x UVC Camera with mount holes at 28x28 mm
- 1x Camera Spacer (RB9.01.060.090)
- 4x M2x8 Screws
- 4x M2 Nuts

**Instructions:**
1. Put 4x nuts M2 from the back side of Camera Holder.
2. Put Camera Spacer and Camera from the front side and fix with 4x screws M2x8.
