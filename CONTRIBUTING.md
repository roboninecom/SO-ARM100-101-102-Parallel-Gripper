## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:
- README.md contributors section
- Release notes
- Project documentation

## License

This project is multi-licensed — see [`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md) for the full map.

By submitting a contribution you certify that you have the right to submit it,
and you agree that it is licensed under the licence that applies to the part of
the repository it lands in:

| You are changing | Your contribution is licensed |
|---|---|
| Hardware / CAD | CERN-OHL-P-2.0 |
| Software | Apache-2.0 |
| Documentation and images | CC BY 4.0 |

In other words, inbound = outbound: whatever licence a file is already under,
your change to it is under the same licence.

**Third-party material.** If your contribution includes anything you did not
create yourself, say so in the pull request so it can be recorded in
[`NOTICE`](NOTICE). Please do not commit binaries you cannot license — that
includes vendor tools and firmware.

**New files** must be covered by [`REUSE.toml`](REUSE.toml). `reuse lint` runs in
pre-commit and in CI, and will fail if any file lacks copyright and licence
information.
